# Morteza Anabestani — Berlin Palimpsest 🗺️✨

Hi — I’m Morteza. I build elegant, resilient software that helps people and teams solve hard problems. I blend strong engineering fundamentals with creative systems-thinking to ship reliable products and delightful developer experiences.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: large-scale distributed systems, developer tooling, and creative data visualizations  
- 🌱 Always learning: Rust, systems programming, and advanced data engineering patterns  
- 💬 Ask me about: APIs, observability, software architecture, and clean developer workflows  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I collect city maps and researcher notes — Berlin inspires this repo's name

---

## What I do
I design and build backend systems, developer tools, and data-driven features. I care about:
- Reliability: monitoring, testing, and observability by design
- Performance: efficient, maintainable implementations
- DX (Developer eXperience): tooling, clear APIs, and great docs
- Collaboration: open source, clear RFCs, and knowledge sharing

---

## Areas of expertise
- Backend engineering: microservices, REST & gRPC, event-driven systems
- Data engineering: ETL, streaming (Kafka), data modeling
- Observability: logging, metrics, tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Tooling & automation: CI/CD, developer CLI tools, local dev environments
- Languages & frameworks: (examples — replace with your top ones) Python, Go, TypeScript, Rust

---

## Top skills (example)
- System design & architecture
- API design & integrations
- Performance optimization & profiling
- Testing strategies & automation
- Open source collaboration

## How I work
- I prefer incremental delivery: small, testable changes and frequent feedback.
- I favor observability-first designs so failures are diagnosable in production.
- I value readable code, clear docs, and actionable tests.

---

## Want to collaborate?
I’m open to:
- Open source contributions and maintainership
